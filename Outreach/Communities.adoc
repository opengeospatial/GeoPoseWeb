# Communities

In addition to informing OGC members, members of the GeoPose SWG reach out and share updates about the specification and the SWG's achievements with the following communities.

## Open AR Cloud

The http://openarcloud.org[Open AR Cloud] is an open association focusing on development of open and interoperable spatial computing technology, data and standards to connect the physical and digital worlds for the benefit of all. Jan-Erik Vinje, co-chair of the GeoPose SWG is executive director of the OARC.

On Feb 13, a link to the GeoPose GitHub was posted on the OARC Discord #GeoPose channel.

## W3C Immersive Web Working Group

The https://www.w3.org/immersive-web/[W3C Immersive Web Working Group] is helping to bring high-performance Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) (collectively known as XR) to the open Web via APIs to interact with XR devices and sensors in browsers. Trevor F Smith is member of W3C Immersive Web community and working groups. On February 16, Trevor suggested during a SWG meeting that he would be sharing that the GeoPose draft spec has been released with IWWG members.

## W3C Web of Things Working Group

The https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/[W3C Web of Things Working Group] is tasked with the standardization or extension of several technological building blocks identified by the Web of Things Interest Group (IG) as being important to advancing the Web of Things. The WoT building blocks are intended to complement existing and emerging IoT standards by focusing on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability.

The Web of Things use cases include geolocated sensors and things. The profiles for geolocated things may include specification of GeoPose for encoding position and orientation.

Christine Perey and Rob Smith are members of the WoT WG. On Feb 24, Michael McCool shared via GitHub issue that he had carefully reviewed GeoPose draft and made his geolocation profile proposal consistent with it. Michael said there are various issues. To read the draft WoT geolocation discovery profile proposal, click https://github.com/w3c/wot-discovery/blob/main/proposals/geolocation.md[here]

## AR for Enterprise Alliance Interoperability and Standards Program

The https://thearea.org/interoperability-and-standards/[AR for Enterprise Alliance Interoperability and Standards Program] seeks to increase knowledge about the benefits and approaches to achieving interoperability and to advance the development of standards or other approaches to interoperability in Augmented Reality components, products and services.

Christine Perey is the leader of the Interoperability and Standards Program leader and will share GeoPose GitHub in the next message she sends to the interested members.

## ETSI Industry Specification Group on AR

The https://www.etsi.org/committee/1420-arf[ETSI ISG ARF] is defining a modular framework for the interoperability of Augmented Reality (AR) components, systems and services that specifies relevant components and interfaces required for an AR solution. Currently, the ISG is working on definition of interoperability requirements for World Capture Function.

Christine Perey is a member of the ETSI ISG ARF.

## Khronos Working Groups

The http://www.khronos.org[Khronos Group] is an open industry consortium of over 150 leading hardware and software companies creating advanced royalty-free acceleration standards for 3D graphics Augmented and Virtual Reality vision and machine learning. Khronos standards include Vulkan® Vulkan® SC OpenGL® OpenGL® ES OpenGL® SC WebGL™ SPIR-V™ OpenCL™ SYCL™ OpenVX™ NNEF™ OpenXR™ 3D Commerce™ ANARI™ and glTF™.

Christine Perey is a member of the Khronos Group OpenXR, 3D Formats, 3D Commerce WGs.

## ISO/IEC JTC1 SC24 (MPEG)

The https://www.mpegstandards.org/[Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG)] develops standards for coded representation of digital audio, video, 3D Graphics and genomic data. The https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:23093:-1:ed-1:v1:en[MPEG Internet of Media Things] working group has published an architecture and is developing encodings, based in part on MPEG-V specifications, for connected sensors observing the real world (e.g., cameras, microphones and other sensors that produce "media"). The geospatially-anchored position and orientation of IoMTs could be encoded in GeoPose.

## Spatial Computing Experts

Avi Bar-Zeev - On March 18, exchanged Tweets with Jan-Erik. He asks what new value GeoPose offers that wasn't available in Placemark (KML). On March 20, Christine reached out to Avi via e-mail, requesting that he visit the GitHub repo and provide feedback.
