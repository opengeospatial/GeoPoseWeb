# About GeoPose Web Resources

On the OGC GeoPose web site (GeoPose.org) there are two pages on which logos of companies appear.

On the Contributors page, the logos of those in the GeoPose SWG.

On the Implementers page, the logos of any business that has implemented GeoPose 1.0.

There is also a gallery page planned. The gallery will feature images of a product or service that illustrates the use of GeoPose 1.0.

# Contributing
If you are a contributor or an implementer, upload your logo in .svg or .png format to the Logos folder. Only files with 512 x 512 pixel dimensions can be used. The URL to which the logo points also needs to be provided in this file.

If you have a project that we can feature in the gallery, please upload an image in 512 x 512 size, in .svg or .png format to the Gallery folder. You must also provide (add) the URL to which the image points in this file.

We will do our best to add all logos to the contributors and implementers pages, and images provided to the gallery page in a timely manner.
